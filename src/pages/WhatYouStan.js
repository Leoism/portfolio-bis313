          This one is a bit challenging for me. However, out of the last few challenges available, this seemed the most reasonable for me. I am not a huge participant in online communities. I do consider myself a part of an online community, but I do not participate as much as others do. I have been a part of Valkyrae’s community since 2019. When I first started following her, she had around 300-400k subscribers on Twitter. Now, she has over 3 million subscribers on Youtube and Instagram, over 2 million on Twitter, played with AOC, been in music videos, won Content Creator of the Year in 2020, and is now Co-Owner of 100 Thieves (One of the biggest esports organizations).
        </p>
        <p>
          So for this challenge, I chose option #2 and I am going to look over how politics quickly took over Valkyrae’s growing community. Having been able to see such drastic growth has definitely allowed me to see how fandoms can change and begin infusing politics and social issues into the community. When I first started following the community, it was not as big as it is now. At the time the community greatly revolved around Fortnite, since it was still big at the time. Besides that, there was not much that the community did besides replying to Rae’s tweets and watching her streams on Twitch. The community was not loud and thus the ability to infuse politics and other social issues into it was difficult.

        <p>
          In 2020, all of that changed with Valkyrae <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae/status/1216759009383874562?s=20">signing a contract with YouTube,</a> the COVID-19 pandemic, and the surge in popularity of Among Us. As Valkyrae gained 100s of thousands of followers a month, the fan community grew more and more. Then came May/June, when one of the biggest movements of 2020 happened. The Black Lives Matter protests. When Rae tweeted her <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae/status/1267600202271096833?s=20">disapproval</a> on how the administration at the time was handling the situation, the community thanked her for speaking on the issue and even pleaded for her to encourage her community to vote. Well, their wishes would soon be met.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Valkyrae was nearing 2 million subscribers on YouTube, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reached out to multiple content creators to help inform viewers on how to register to vote and encourage them to vote. On October 20, with all content creators combined, they managed to reach <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aoc-plays-among-us-twitch-most-watched-streams/">700k viewers LIVE</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/11/15/aoc-twitch-stream-wthh/">over 5 million viewers</a> post stream. The fan community was pleased that day. Later, on election day, Valkyrae would go on to upload a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae/status/1323760669104107521?s=20">picture of herself showing she had voted.</a> The fan community was quick to show support and even show themselves having voted as well. I also went out to vote on that day :P, even though I live in a mail-in ballot state. Then, on January 6, 2021, Valkyrae <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae/status/1346958414388154369?s=20">posted a tweet</a> showing her disgust with the way police were behaving and the situation at the Capitol. Again, the majority of the community agreed with her and thanked her for not remaining silent on the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did Valkyrae experience massive growth, but her community did as well. The fan community shifted from being a passive community to being an active community asking Valkyrae to speak on issues. I believe that the fan community played a large role in getting Rae to speak on political issues. I am not saying she would have ignored these issues had she not grown in size, but she possibly would not have publicly spoken on these issues.
