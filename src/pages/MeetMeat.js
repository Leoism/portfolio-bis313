          Throughout the course of the pandemic, I saw growth in my dependency on the internet. Online classes, virtual internships, and online friendships. Prior to the pandemic, I did not heavily rely on the internet. I rarely spent more than an hour on Twitter, Reddit, or YouTube. Now, I log around 8-10 hours a day on my phone, largely on social media platforms.

          I tend to be a reserved person. I do not vocalize my opinions loudly, I try to not upset people, and I also try to avoid confrontation. However, with the pandemic, I think that changed. Why do I think that changed? Because of the participatory media culture of social media.

          Henry Jenkins’s definition of participatory media culture can be summarized as people building ideas off of each other, where anybody can participate, and people believe their ideas matter. The keywords here are “people believe their ideas matter.” Why is this important? I think that is one of the causes of my increase in social media usage. I see one of my tweets got more than 100 likes and I think that my opinion mattered. I was somebody that rarely voiced their opinions, yet there are people online that agree with me? There was something happening here... I began feeling included.

          Twitter was built for participatory media culture. Literally, all you have to do is make an account with an email and you’re all set to start tweeting. The process is so easy, yet the things you can do are so much. I can see why I started to use Twitter more because I felt that every tweet mattered to at least one person. Looking back at the concept of participatory media culture, I feel that social media platforms were built with this concept in mind. How do can you increase users, and maintain users? Make it easy to access the platform, and have them believe that their ideas matter.

          As I used Twitter more and more, I started to find like-minded people. I started finding people that are interested in the same things as me, and before I knew it, I was a part of a fandom. The concept of fandom literally builds on top of participatory media culture. A fandom is a community of fans that participate in fan activities in some way. This is the definition that Stitch from TeenVogue gave and they specifically used the word “participate.” I don’t know how it can get any clearer than that.

          Similar to social media, entering a fandom is as easy as being a fan of something. Henry Jenkins explained that participatory media culture is a place where anybody can participate and we can see that with fandoms. However, with a small caveat, you should be a fan of the thing the fandom focuses on. Besides that caveat, almost everything between the two is the same. Fans generally have the same thinking, at least with the thing they are a fan of; therefore, they are more likely to believe that their ideas matter. If one day somebody suggests that they throw some fan event, other fans can begin inputting their thoughts, and then they start building ideas on top of each other. And that is what participatory media culture is, people building ideas from one another, thinking that their ideas matter, and literally any fan can participate.

          Without social media and the pandemic, I probably wouldn’t have found the people I did online. I probably wouldn’t be expressing my ideas as much. I still have a hard time expressing my ideas in “meat space,” but I am working on that. The pandemic, and the internet, helped me to better express myself, at least online. I think if I can just pretend that life is one giant Twitter, I will be fine.
